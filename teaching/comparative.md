title: Comparative Political Economy
permalink: /teaching/comparative/
---
This course offers an introduction to the theoretical and empirical research in
comparative political economy. An emphasis will be placed on the parallel process of political and economic
development across countries and its consequences on current democratic political institutions such as:
electoral rules, parliamentary versus presidential governments, legislatures, judicial systems, and bureaucratic
agencies as exemplifed in central bank politics. We will study the differential impact of these political
institutions on the type of policies they implement and the economic outcomes they produce. The main
objective of the course will be to assess the robustness of the analyzed theories in light of their empirical
support.
