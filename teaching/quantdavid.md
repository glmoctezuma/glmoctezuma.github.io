title: Quantitative Analysis I

---
The course serves as an introduction to probability theory and
statistical inference. The material serves as a basis for subsequent
courses in statistics (572, 574), and the material will also be quite
helpful to those interested in game theory courses. Although we will
illustrate concepts with substantive examples whenever possible, this
is not a very applied course. Rather, this course is focused more on
establishing and learning basic concepts and developing the tools and
techniques needed to move on to more advanced material. I precepted
this course for [David Carter](https://www.princeton.edu/~dbcarter) in the
fall of 2013.
