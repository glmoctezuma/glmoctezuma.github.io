title: Topics in Political Economy
permalink: /teaching/topics/
---
This course surveys key topics of active research in political economics. We will
provide an analytical framework to study the strategic interaction
between political and economic systems. However, the emphasis of the
course will be empirical, focusing on theory-to-data approaches
including both structural research and reduced-form evidence under the
potential outcomes framework. Topics cover the analysis of voting
institutions and political behavior, the constraints imposed by political institutiions on
economic policy and outcomes, and the role of special interests in
politics through the lobbying process.
