title: Politics Math Camp
permalink: /teaching/mathcamp/
---
The math camp reviews basic calculus and linear algebra, as well as it
introduces the fundamental ideas of real analysis necessary for
graduate courses in formal and quantitative methods.
The goal of the camp is twofold. The first is to provide an
opportunity to review the basic tools in calculus and linear algebra
by solving a number of practice problems. To achieve this goal, the
math camp is NOT designed to teach these materials to students for the
first time. Rather, it focuses on applying basic calculus and
linear algebra tools to solve mathematical problems. The course starts
with preview materials PRIOR to the camp. The second
goal is to facilitate a smooth transition to the mathematical
foundation course (POL 502). For this goal, the course covers the basic
concepts of real analysis. Specifically, the camp ensures that
students can use these basic concepts to prove mathematical
propositions. POL 502 is built on the materials covered in this
part of the camp. I co-taught this camp with [Yuki Shiraito](http://scholar.princeton.edu/shiraito) in the
summer of 2014.
