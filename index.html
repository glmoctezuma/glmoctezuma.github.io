     hspace="23"><p> I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science
     in the Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences at
     the California Institute of Technology. Previously, I was a
    Post-Doctoral Associate in the Cowles Foundation for Research
  in Economics at Yale University. I hold a Ph.D. in Politics from Princeton
  University where I was part of the Research Program in Political
     Economy and received the Charlotte Elizabeth Procter Fellowship.

  My research analyzes collective
  decision-making in committees and elections using different quantitative methods, such as
  structural estimation, causal inference, and text analysis. I study
  the effects of sequential decision-making at the Federal Open Market
  Committee (FOMC) and the
  U.S. Supreme Court. My research also focuses on electoral
  competition and voting behavior in the U.S., Mexico and the Philippines.
