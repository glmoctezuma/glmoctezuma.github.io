  in Economics at Yale University. I will join the California Institute of Technology as
  an Assistant Professor in the Division of Humanities and Social
  Sciences in 2017. I received my Ph.D. in Politics from Princeton
  University where I was enrolled in the program in Political Economy.<br>
  <br>
  My research analyzes collective
  decision-making in committees and elections using different quantitative methods, such as
  structural estimation, causal inference, and text analysis. I have studied the effects of sequential deliberation on
  decision-making at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the effects of deliberation in electoral politics using
  evidence from a randomized field experiment in the Philippines. My research also uses structural
  estimation to analyze dynamic decision-making problems in electoral
  politics with a focus on U.S. senatorial and presidential elections.
