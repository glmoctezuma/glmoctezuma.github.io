<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
We examine the efficiency of the Mexican exchange rate market for the
period 1997-2007. We reject both covered and uncovered interest
rate parity conditions for the USD-MXN exchange rate. Exploiting the exchange
rate expectations from a survey of professional forecasters we attribute the
encountered inefficiencies to both a time-varying risk premium and
investors' systematic biases. On the one hand, risk premium induces
investors to over-predict the peso depreciation. On the other hand,
investors' systematic biases show a particular time structure: in the short term
they over-estimate the peso depreciation, whereas in
the medium term they under-estimate it, offsetting the risk premium effect.
