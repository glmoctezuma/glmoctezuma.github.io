<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
This document analyzes inflation, exchange rate, interest rate, and
GDP growth forecasts from the monthly Survey of Professional
Forecasters, maintained by Banco de MÃ©xico. The study concentrates on
the mean across forecasters for the period from January 1995 to
April 2008. Their efficiency in the use of information is examined, as
well as their relative performance using as benchmarks forecasts
obtained from time-series, macroeconomic, and financial variables. In
general, consensus forecasts do not pass tests of unbiasedness, lack
of serial correlation, and efficient use of available information,
suggesting opportunities to improve the quality of these
forecasts. However, the forecasts seem to be, in general, more
accurate than the benchmark forecasts, although this relative
forecasting advantage appears to diminish in a sample that starts in
January 2002.
