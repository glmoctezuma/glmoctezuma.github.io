<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
We analyze the forecasts of inflation and GDP growth contained in the
Banco de México’s Survey of Professional Forecasters for the period
1995–2009. The forecasts are for the current and the following year,
and comprise an unbalanced three-dimensional panel with multiple
individual forecasters, target years, and forecast horizons. The
fixed-event nature of the forecasts enables us to examine their
efficiency by looking at the revision process. The panel structure
allows us to control for aggregate shocks and to construct a measure
of the news that impacted expectations in the period under study. We
find that respondents anchor to their initial forecasts, updating
their revisions smoothly as they receive more information. In
addition, they do not seem to use publicly-known information in an
efficient manner. These inefficiencies suggest clear areas of
opportunity for improving the accuracy of the forecasts, for instance
by taking into account the positive autocorrelation found in forecast revisions.
