<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
In a randomized experiment in cooperation with two national parties competing
in a congressional election in the Philippines, we estimate the causal effect on voting
behavior of a town-hall style campaign in which candidates discuss their campaign
platform with small groups of citizens. Keeping the parties’ platform fixed, we find
that town-hall meetings have a positive effect on parties’ vote shares compared to the
status quo, in which voters play a passive role. Consistent with the parties’ advocacy
for underprivileged groups, we observe heterogeneous effects by income, education
and gender. Deliberative campaigns increase voters’ awareness on the issues parties
campaign on, affecting the vote of the direct beneficiaries of the parties’ platform.
