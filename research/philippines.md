<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
In a randomized experiment in cooperation with two national parties
competing in the 2013 congressional election in the Philippines, we estimate the
causal effect on voting behavior of a town-hall style campaign in which candidates
debate with voters. Keeping the parties’ platform fixed, we find that
this “deliberative” style has a positive effect on parties’ vote shares compared to the status quo, in
which voters play a passive role. Consistent with the parties’
advocacy for underprivileged groups, we observe heterogeneous effects by income and gender. We show that the
larger effect of town-hall meetings on women and poor voters arises
because deliberative campaigns are more effective in changing voters’
attitudes on gender inequality and poverty, as emphasized in parties’ platforms.
