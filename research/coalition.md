title: Sleeping with the Enemy: Effective Representation
under Dynamic Electoral Competition

<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
Electoral coalitions between ideologically incompatible parties|among other unconventional
electoral strategies|may seem to threaten effective representation, signaling
a breakdown of programmatic politics. However, this perspective overlooks parties' and
voters' dynamic considerations. We propose and estimate a model of dynamic electoral
competition in which a short-term ideology compromise, via an electoral coalition, offers
opposition parties (and voters) the opportunity to remove an entrenched incumbent
party from office, thus leveling the playing field in the future. This tradeoff provides
a previously unrecognized rationale for coalition formation in elections. We take our
model to data from Mexican municipal elections between 1995-2016 and show that
coalitions between parties on opposite ends of the ideology spectrum have served as an
instrument of democratic consolidation
