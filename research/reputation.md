<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
How do career concerns affect the decision-making of public officials?
In this paper, we study this problem in the context of the Federal
Open Market Committee (FOMC). To tackle this problem, we combine a
structural approach with an unanticipated change in the information
available to the public about internal committee
deliberations. Exploiting the regime change and the restrictions on
behavior implied by the equilibrium of the model, we (i) estimate the
intrinsic value that FOMC members give to reputation, (ii) clarify the
distortions in behavior induced by career concerns, (iii) quantify the
probability of correct recommendations, and (iv) assess the
performance of the FOMC under committee compositions and economic
conditions not observed in the data. While the conventional wisdom
suggests that Transparency can be detrimental to welfare by inducing
anti-pandering and conformism, our results challenge this view. We
show that career concerns have significant effect on equilibrium
outcomes, but that the dominant effect of career concerns is to
moderate biases, in order to mimic expert behavior. This counteracts
heterogeneity in preferences, and can lead to improvements in welfare,
even in spite of increased conformity for some committee members.
