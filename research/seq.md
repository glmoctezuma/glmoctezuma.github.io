<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
I estimate a model of policymaking that incorporates
social learning via deliberation. In the model, committee members
speak in sequence, balancing their private information and
biases against recommendations made by others. I quantify the extent
of social learning in the Federal Open Market Committee. I find
that the process of deliberation significantly changes individual behavior
and aggregate monetary policy: the average committee member
changes her recommendation in approximately 36 percent of the meetings
after listening to previous speakers. Counterfactual simulations
show that the observed deliberation order within the FOMC has been
effective at reducing the probability of mistakes.
