<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
We quantify the extent to which Supreme Court justices learn
  from each other. We analyze
  conference votes, which are cast behind closed doors in order of
  seniority. We provide causal evidence that junior justices
  systematically incorporate the votes of their senior colleagues.  To
  explain this evidence, we
  augment existing theories of judicial decision making by introducing
  social learning into a structural model of sequential voting in the
  Court. In our model, justices make decisions under incomplete
  information and incorporate their preferences, public and private
  information, and the choices of previous justices in the voting
  sequence. We show that the information contained in the voting
  history affects the outcome of the Court in 18% of cases. We compute the effect of the seniority rule on the quality of Supreme Court's rulings and compare it to alternative voting mechanisms.
