<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
We introduce a method for scaling two data sets from different sources. The
proposed method estimates a latent component common to both datasets as
well as an idiosyncratic component unique to each. The scaled
locations can be modeled as a function of covariates, and efficient
implementation allows for inference through resampling methods. A
simulation study shows that our proposed method outperforms existing alternatives in
recovering latent dimensions. We employ our method to recover latent policy
positions of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members around the
financial crisis of 2008 using both
their speech and policy recommendations obtained from monetary policy
meetings.
