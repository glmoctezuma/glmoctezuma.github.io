<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
Quantifying the value that legislators give to reelection relative to policy is
crucial to understanding electoral accountability. We estimate the preferences
for office and policy of members of the US Senate, using a structural approach
that exploits variation in polls, position-taking and advertising throughout the
electoral cycle. We then combine these preference estimates with estimates
of the electoral effectiveness of policy moderation and political advertising to
quantify electoral accountability in competitive and uncompetitive
elections. We find that senators differ markedly in the value they give to
securing office relative to policy gains: while over a fourth of senators are highly ideological, a
sizable number of senators are willing to make relatively large policy concessions
to attain electoral gains. Nevertheless, electoral accountability is only moderate
on average, due to the relatively low impact of changes in senators' policy stance
on voter support.
