<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
We introduce a dynamic model of position-taking and advertising,
in which politicians trade off policy and reelection. We estimate ca-
reer concerns for US senators, and quantify how preferences for office
and policy affect electoral accountability. Senators are typically willing
to make significant policy concessions for electoral gains: the median
senator is willing to give up 5% of the average distance between voters
and politicians for a 1% increase in the probability of reelection. There
is, however, substantial heterogeneity, which covaries with observable
characteristics. Given estimated voter responsiveness, accountability is
low on average, but high for office-motivated senators in competitive
elections.
