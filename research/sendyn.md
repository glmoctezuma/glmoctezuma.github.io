<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
Incumbent politicians seeking reelection face an inherently dynamic
problem: they observe the change in their poll standing and incoming
contributions, and respond by adjusting their political stances and by
spending money in political advertising. In this paper, we formulate a
model that captures this problem and estimate the model using data for
US senators. Our empirical strategy allows us to obtain an estimate of
senatorsâ€™ policy preferences that discounts pandering.
