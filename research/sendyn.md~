title: Sequential Deliberation in Collective Decision-Making

<h1 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"> Abstract</h1>
A process of deliberation, in which policymakers exchange information prior to
formal voting procedures, precedes almost every collective decision. Yet, beyond scarce evidence coming from field and laboratory experiments, few
studies have analyzed the role played by sequential deliberation in
policy-relevant decision-making bodies. To fill this gap, I estimate an empirical model of policy-making that incorporates social learning
via deliberation. In the model, committee members speak in sequence, allowing them to weight their
own information and biases against recommendations made by others. The
empirical application uses historical transcripts from the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC), which is the body in charge of implementing monetary policy in
the United States. I
find the process of deliberation significantly changes members' policy
recommendations compared to the case where members follow their
private information. Incorporating
sequential learning explains the pattern of individual
recommendations and collective choices extremely well and improves the fit over behavioral
models that ignore deliberation.
